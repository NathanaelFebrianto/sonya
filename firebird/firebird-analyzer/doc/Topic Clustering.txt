동일한 Cluster에 속한 Topic User들에 대해서
t: Topic(T개)
c: Cluster(I개)
u: User(J개)
k: TopicUser(N개)

If (User(u) == TopicUser(k))

Else If (User(u) following TopicUser(k))
   weight for TopicUser(k) =  0.5
Else
   weight for TopicUser(k) = 0.2

Score of User(u) by Topic(t) = [SUM of {score of TopicUser(k)*weight for TopicUser(k)} / number of TopicUsers in Cluster(c)] * Authority of User(u)
